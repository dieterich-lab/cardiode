# CARDIO:DE

CARDIO:DE is the first distributable and freely available German corpus containing 500 discharge letters from the cardiology deparment of the Heidelberg University Hospital covering a broad range of cardiovascular clinical routine documents.

All discharge letters were carefully anonymized by domain experts using automatic and manual methods.

CARDIO:DE contains manual gold standard annotations of:

1. medication information (ActiveIng, Dosage, Drug, Duration, Form, Frequency, Reason, Route, Strength)
2. section types (Abschluss, Anamnese, Anrede, Diagnosen, AufnahmeMedikation, Befunde, EchoBefunde, AktuellDiagnosen, EntlassMedikation, KuBefunde, Labor, Anderes, RisikofaktorenAllergien, Zusammenfassung)


CARDIO:DE is split into CARDIO:DE400 and CARDIO:DE100. Discharge letters of CARDIO:DE400 (including annotations) and CARDIO:DE100 can be requested via this website. Annotations of CARDIO:DE100 are kept internally as held-out data for future shared task purposes.

All discharge letters of CARDIO:DE are distributed as tsv3 (<a href="https://webanno.github.io/webanno/releases/3.4.5/docs/user-guide.html#sect_webannotsv">documentation</a>) files. Results of baselne models for medication information extraction and section type classification can be found in the CARDIO:DE publication.
